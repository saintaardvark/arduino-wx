  - so it turns out the transmitter is continuously resetting itself.
    If I add a debug statement, I can see that it gets as far as the
    second loop before resetting; the serial port shows the pressure
    sensor test again & again.
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22647210/what-can-cause-arduino-to-continuously-restart
      suggests memory, which seems likely given the number of
      libraries I'm including.
    - Maybe accidentally hitting the reset pin from software?

  - OMFG, can *listen* to the signal on 433 MHz receiver!
    - data from RX to one ring of headphones, ground to ground
      ring....amazing way to tune reception.  Could hear it clear out
      across courtyard.

  - Not necessarily getting better perf from rx with antenna
  - tuning pulse length to 250 or 500 ms makes a *huge* difference
    - Added all *kinds of debugging code to Receiver library to track
      down problem: bad CRC.
    - Came across
      https://github.com/zeitgeist87/RFReceiver/issues/2#issuecomment-284136307,
      and sure enough it worked.
  - had to do a "make clean" to fix problems with rx not receiving any
    data.  Mixup in pulse length?
  - Very roughly, can use coil (either the copper ones I bought, or
    hte ones I made) as direction of antenna -- so pointing it between
    tx/rx seems to help a lot.
  - Next up: merge the JSON in.

  - Test suite!
    - Aha, floating point precision means numbers are off.  That's
      okay, need to figure out how to get the conversion to just say
      "That's enough"
    - *Think* the two error tests are passing...should move them to
      separate tst
    - Need to switch to float64? Book says 64 preferred over 32.
    - Tests working!
  - Merged nrf24l01 branch to master.

  - Trying to remember InfluxDB stuff...
    - https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/concepts/key_concepts/
    - Database is "weather"
    - measurement: "conceptually similar to a table."  Looking in
      current DB, I have a shitton of measurements, so let's break it
      out a bit:
      - humidity
      - precipitation
      - pressure
      - temperature
    - field keys/values/units:
      - For temp:
        | Value | 22 |
        | Units |  C |
      - For humidity:
        | Value | 72 |
        | Units |  % |
      - etc
      - not sure if units needed
k    - Tags keys/values:
      | Location | BBY   |
      | Arduino  | Node1 |
      | Lat      | 49.2  |
      | Long     | 112.3 |
      | ...      |       |
    - All right, now this is starting to make sense again
