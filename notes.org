  - so it turns out the transmitter is continuously resetting itself.
    If I add a debug statement, I can see that it gets as far as the
    second loop before resetting; the serial port shows the pressure
    sensor test again & again.
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22647210/what-can-cause-arduino-to-continuously-restart
      suggests memory, which seems likely given the number of
      libraries I'm including.
    - Maybe accidentally hitting the reset pin from software?
